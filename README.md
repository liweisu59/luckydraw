## Welcome to Ephemeral Lucky Draw!

This is a place for sharing anonymous thoughts, secrets, and kind words. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### The Concept

Everyone gets 3 "draws" per day.

You can use a draw to pull a random, anonymous message left by another user.

Once a message is read, it's gone forever. No one else will ever see it, not even the creator.

You can also submit your own anonymous messages into the "void" for others to find.

It's a way to share a piece of your mind and connect anonymously with a stranger, one fleeting moment at a time.

### How to Play

It's simple!

1. To Share a Message:

- Type anything you like into the "Leave a Message for a Stranger" box.

- Click the "Send to the Void" button. Your message is now waiting for someone to discover it.

2. To Draw a Message:

- You'll see how many draws you have left for the day (you start with 3).

- Click the "Draw a Message" button.

- A modal will pop up showing you a message from a random stranger.

- Read it, enjoy it, and when you close it, it's gone forever.

3. What happens when I run out?

- Once your draws hit "0", you'll have to wait until tomorrow for them to reset back to 3.

Enjoy the experience!
